<h1>GitHub:</h1>
GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git, a version control system, to host and manage software development projects. It enables collaboration, tracks changes, and provides tools for managing the development workflow.

<h2>Core Concepts:</h2>
Repository (Repo):

01. A repository is a storage space for a project, containing all files and their revision history.
Repos can be public (visible to everyone) or private (restricted access).
Branch:

02 A branch is an independent line of development within a repo.
The default branch is typically main or master.
Developers create branches to work on features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.
Commit:

03. A commit is a snapshot of changes made to files in a branch.
Each commit has a unique identifier (hash) and often includes a message describing the changes.
Pull Request (PR):

04. A pull request is a proposal to merge changes from one branch into another.
It allows for code review, testing, and and collaboration before merging the changes into the target branch.

Expanded Explanation:
Code Review: Team members can review the changes, provide feedback, and suggest improvements to ensure code quality and consistency.
Testing: Changes can be tested in a controlled environment to confirm they don't introduce bugs or break existing functionality.
Collaboration: Developers can discuss and refine the changes through comments or by committing additional improvements to the branch.
A pull request acts as a safeguard to ensure only well-reviewed and tested code is integrated into the main branch or another target branch.
